/*
Type: Creational
Pattern: Prototype

Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldnâ€™t depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.
Use the pattern when you want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their respective objects.
	Somebody could have created these subclasses to be able to create objects with a specific configuration.
