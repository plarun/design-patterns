/*
Type: Behavioural
Pattern: Command

Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. 
This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

Use the Command pattern when you want to parametrize objects with operations.
Use the Command pattern when you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.
Use the Command pattern when you want to implement reversible operations.
