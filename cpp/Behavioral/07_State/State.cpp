/*
Type: Behavioural
Pattern: State

Lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

Use the State pattern when you have an object that behaves differently depending on its current state, 
	the number of states is enormous, and the state-specific code changes frequently.
Use the pattern when you have a class polluted with massive conditionals that alter how the class behaves according to the current values of the classâ€™s fields.
Use State when you have a lot of duplicate code across similar states and transitions of a condition-based state machine.
